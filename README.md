# Kunth-Morris-Pratt-Algorithm
* The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm allows efficient searching for patterns in non-indexed strings. The first step in the KMP algorithm is to construct the failure links automaton for the pattern that we need to search for then apply the search technique.
# Functions
* getPrefix
```
Function to calculate each iteration prefix.
```
* getPropersuffix
```
 Function to calculate proper suffixes of each iteration.
```
* preprocessing
```
Function to calculate failure link of pattern.
```
* Search
```
Function to report the match between pattern and text.
```
* KMP
```
 Main function of KMP.
